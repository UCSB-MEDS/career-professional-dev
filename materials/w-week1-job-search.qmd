- [**Step 1: Explore and Identify Your 3-Boxes.**]{.teal-text} Continue reflecting on and identifying what might fit into each of your three boxes: Box 1, Box 2, and Box 3. Consider several factors such as sectors, locations, job levels, divisions, job titles, duties, salary considerations, or any other factors that resonate with you. If you're still in the process of figuring all of this out, that is okay. Take the time now to start reflecting on your career goals and aspirations and bring your thoughts, questions, and concerns to your Winter Career Appointment. The beginning of this quarter is the time to start this deep reflection before courses and capstones get busier. This will lead to you conducting a higher quality job search that is tailored to what you would truly like to do. [For inspiration, see this example shared by a MEDS 2023 alum.](https://dg8u9ghab.cc.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=001RhQonTk1lW4WxIaQdLmTxy38gBuCmQKMOHshezCpRFYDhRapivOu4dh0TTHWe77tWVu0XccFbLmoBFTvXe5N_1vpVHPSH7XWnMuqz-JktNaKR3suiA2hwv7Wvpw_TOlhEzHl7WcQq0IoMG56gDjlToMwQr8CgXfAQDloNwpRUiil8Hg5jgKvY1kKImuN5zpm&c=diNPK5ArKEfpCUZlkCtI4UXMt1T2aDBwHgOLvmt4WEbnyyNb2ysUVg==&ch=cvoIyCMoGeL5qCTH5cnzjdMECA8CjVW6s1Rp1NO-pjZXH9Q8dzV08A==){target="_blank"} 

- [**Step 2: Create Your List of Target Organizations.**]{.teal-text} Next, compile a list of companies/organizations that align with your three boxes. These are the companies/organizations where you can envision applying your skills and talents in a meaningful way. Continue adding to your list as you move through the MEDS program and learn about new companies/organizations. These two actions aren't about having it all figured out right away. However, it is about committing to starting your job search, exploring possible career paths, and reflecting on your own career goals and aspirations; no easy task! We encourage you to start thinking about this now, and please know we are here to support you every step of the way. 

- [**Step 3: Identify Contacts for Your Target Organizations.**]{.teal-text} Utilize the [Alumni & Student Finder](https://dg8u9ghab.cc.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=001WeuU4XP05SU0JEBxs9GRJ0XCA_QeNKPlZ4SYmeBfaBvHssH_WIEP4U_k1SN4DA2HqeMlFOCrh_knmzkL5seFhV0Br1NRbgLD0dybm5j8DC5y_YFMjMI1UPORhuY8i87MVS3rAtQC_FwFQ1DmII73k-hsMyM_4wdM2sj9L9C_m0K_CFNLzuP5kQ==&c=9NEQaGinDj_AmrFPOIhq6vIwRTVC-Ze-XEanzKvBjP98OQriloKBxg==&ch=LCCiPgWfqaaG8yU_-b6o4QezlXD--tbiHV632fJAtrRas82sPgkLhA==){target="_blank"}, LinkedIn, and your personal professional contacts to identify a contact for each company/organization on your list. **PRO TIP:** If you can't find a contact for a few organizations, ask your existing contacts if they know someone at those organizations. Often, you can fill in the blanks through your connections. 

- [**Step 4: Reach Out to Your Contacts for Guidance.**]{.teal-text} Over the next few weeks, email 1-3 alumni or personal professional contacts on your list to request a brief in-person, Zoom, or phone meeting. This will help you continue to explore potential jobs and career paths, jump-start your networking, and help you develop lifelong contacts and mentors. 

- [**Step 5: Sign up for your Winter Career Appointment by Friday, January 16 at 5PM.**]{.teal-text} Look out for an email from your assigned career advisor (either Dave, Amanda, or Miya) by the end of the week with instructions on how to sign up for your appointment. Please feel free to bring your questions, comments, or concerns related to your 3-Boxes to this appointment. We look forward to supporting you.

## {{< fa clipboard-list title="a clipboard with a To Do list" >}} Pre-workshop Prep {#pre-workshop-prep}

Please be sure to complete the following before the workshop:

### A. Install software / Create accounts

MEDS students should already have the following installed / created from summer session (but it's worth double-checking!):

::: {.callout-note collapse=true icon=false}
## To follow along, you'll need:
- [R](https://cloud.r-project.org/){target="_blank"} & [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/#download){target="_blank"} installed
- Quarto installed – **Quarto is now included with RStudio v2022.07.1+ i.e. no need for a separate download / install if you have the latest version of RStudio**
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/){target="_blank"} installed / configured
- A [GitHub](https://github.com/){target="_blank"} account & a [personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#about-personal-access-tokens){target="_blank"} (PAT) set

Please refer to the [MEDS Installation Guide](https://ucsb-meds.github.io/MEDS-installation-guide/){target="_blank"}  for detailed setup instructions.

### B. Gather materials to add to your website's landing page

During this session, you'll have the opportunity to add some personal information to your website's landing page. It'll help to have an idea of what you might want to include (at least as a starting point -- your website's content will most certainly evolve over time). Consider the following before attending the workshop:

1. [**Have your professional headshot handy.**]{.teal-text} Your Bren photo is a great option here! Save your photo to your Desktop (or somewhere you can easily find again) for now.
2. [**Consider which landing page template to use.**]{.teal-text} We'll be applying one of Quarto's five available [built-in templates](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-about.html#templates){target="_blank"}  when we create our website's landing page. Take a peek at the template previews and identify which one(s) you like most (e.g. I'm currently a fan of `jolla`, but used `trestles` for a long while). Consider how you'd like to arrange your personal bio / info given the layout of your top choice template.
3. [**Draft a personal bio or tagline for your landing page.**]{.teal-text} I recommend something that's *different* than your Bren bio -- a shorter, catchier one that's infused with a bit more of your personality -- though you may certainly consider reusing parts of your Bren bio (taglines are great here too!). Consider the tips and examples in the dropdown, below. Save your text in a place you can quickly copy from during class (e.g. your personal branding guide document!).

## Some considerations and example website bios
- **Resepct your readers' time.** The average attention span of an internet user is [~8 seconds](https://time.com/3858309/attention-spans-goldfish/#:~:text=The%20average%20attention%20span%20for%20the%20notoriously,an%20increasingly%20digitalized%20lifestyle%20on%20the%20brain.){target="_blank"}, which means you want to succintly share your most important qualities, interests, and personal facts. Keeping website bios short and to-the-point is ideal. Save longer-form bios for a different page (e.g. I have a separate ["about" page](https://samanthacsik.github.io/about.html){target="_blank"} where I share about myself in a bit more detail)
    - Here's a nice short post on [crafting a personal tagline](https://www.knitis.nyc/post/writing-a-personal-tagline){target="_blank"} and another with tips on [writing a personal bio](https://www.linkedin.com/advice/0/how-can-you-write-professional-bio-your-website-skills-writing){target="_blank"}
- **Choose the right landing page [template](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-about.html#templates){target="_blank"} for your bio.** For example, `jolla` works well with short bios or taglines, while `trestles` might be a better choice if you're looking to add longer and / or multiple sections. 
- **Check out a few example websites for bio inspiration.** Here are just a small handful of websites, each with a slightly different approach to their landing page bios:
    - [Samantha Shanny-Csik](https://samanthacsik.github.io/){target="_blank"} (yours truly)
    - [Nick Lyon](https://njlyon0.github.io/){target="_blank"} (NCEAS Data Analyst)
    - [Ray Hunter](https://ramhunte.github.io/){target="_blank"} (MESM 2024)
    - [Sam Muir](https://shmuir.github.io/){target="_blank"} (MEDS 2024)
    - [Melissa Widas](https://mwidas.github.io/){target="_blank"} (MEDS 2024)
    - [Marine Kochuten](https://marinakochuten.github.io/){target="_blank"} (MEDS 2025)
    - [Olivia Hemond](https://ohemond25.github.io/oliviahemond.github.io/){target="_blank"} (MESM 2025)

4. [**Gather your important public profile links.**]{.teal-text} Your personal website is an excellent place to link out to your other public profiles in one, organized place (again, your personal branding guide is a great place to keep these). Bookmark / save the links you'd like to include (e.g. LinkedIn, GitHub, even your preferred email address)

## {{< fa plus title="plus" >}} What should I continue working on? {#continue-working}

- [**Revisit & seek feedback on your personal bio.**]{.teal-text} Does your landing page bio fit your personal brand? Consider what information you include and your tone – does it make sense to revise your bio to better fit your brand? Consider if your chosen [template](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-about.html#templates){target="_blank"} suits your needs, or if a different layout might work better. Share your bio with friends, family, a Career Team member, etc. and ask for their thoughts / feedback. You should also revisit your bio regularly (at least once a year) to make sure the content is still relevant and reflects your professional and personal identity.
- [**Consider editing or adding additional pages.**]{.teal-text} Your website scaffolding includes an "about" page where you may consider adding a longer-form biography or information. You may also decide to add additional pages, as needed.
- [**Hide any pages that aren't "complete."**]{.teal-text} Want to include an "about" page (e.g. like [mine](https://samanthacsik.github.io/about.html){target="_blank"}) but don't quite have the content sorted out yet? It's best to hide this until you're ready to share something that's fairly polished. Comment out the necessary pages in `_quarto.yml` (see example below), then rebuild your site and push to GitHub. ***Note** that while you can do this for almost all in-progess pages, you **must keep `index.qmd`** "live" (i.e. don't comment it out).*

Please be sure to complete the following before class:

### A. Have your personal branding guide ready to reference

This is also a good opportunity to revisit and revise your branding guide if necessary, including your chosen color palette and Google Font families, image assets, and personal logo and / or favicon (optional).


<!-- One of the most exciting parts of building a website is deciding on which colors you’ll use. This can take some time and tweaking, so it’s helpful to think a bit about your palette beforehand. We’ll consider updating colors for the following website elements:

Navigation Bar: navbar background color, foreground (text) color, hover highlight color
Main Body: body background color, body text color, hyperlink color, in-line code color, inline-code background color
Page Footer: footer background color
We’ll be using a language called Sass to create variables for each of the colors we plan to use throughout our websites (more on that soon!).

It’s helpful to draft up your color variables ahead of time (and save them to your personal branding guide) so that you easily copy them into your stylesheet during class. Define your color variables using the syntax, $variable-name: value;, where you decide on your variable-name, and value is a HEX color code (htmlcolorcodes.com is my favorite site for grabbing HEX codes). -->

## {{< fa plus title="plus" >}} What should I continue working on? {#continue-working}

- [**Finish applying your colors to different website elements using [Quarto’s Sass variables](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-themes.html#sass-variables){target="_blank"}.**]{.teal-text} And test out different color combos and / or fonts if you’re not totally satisfied with your original choices. This is arguably the most fun part of building your website and where you can really let your personality and brand shine through. It can take a while to settle on something that you feel really represents you, and that’s okay (I’ve changed my entire color scheme and fonts multiple times over the years).
- [**Consider writing / borrowing / adapting CSS rules to refine your website styling.**]{.teal-text} You can take your website styling far just by defining Quarto’s Sass variables. However, if you’re looking to fine-tune the appearance of certain web page elements, you may consider turning to more CSS. Review the [workshop slides](https://ucsb-meds.github.io/customizing-quarto-websites/#/title-slide){target="_blank"} for suggested approaches and tools to guide your CSS-writing journey.

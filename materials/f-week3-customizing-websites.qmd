## {{< fa plus title="plus" >}} What should I continue working on? {#continue-working}

- [**Finish applying your colors to different website elements using [Quarto’s Sass variables](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-themes.html#sass-variables){target="_blank"}.**]{.teal-text} And test out different color combos and / or fonts if you’re not totally satisfied with your original choices. This is arguably the most fun part of building your website and where you can really let your personality and brand shine through. It can take a while to settle on something that you feel really represents you, and that’s okay (I’ve changed my entire color scheme and fonts multiple times over the years).
- [**Consider writing / borrowing / adapting CSS rules to refine your website styling.**]{.teal-text} You can take your website styling far just by defining Quarto’s Sass variables. However, if you’re looking to fine-tune the appearance of certain web page elements, you may consider turning to more CSS. Review the [workshop slides](https://ucsb-meds.github.io/customizing-quarto-websites/#/title-slide){target="_blank"} for suggested approaches and tools to guide your CSS-writing journey.

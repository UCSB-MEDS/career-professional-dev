## {{< fa plus title="plus" >}} What should I continue working on? {#continue-working}

- [**Continue iterating on your personal brand and seek feedback from those who know you well.**]{.teal-text} Would they use the same adjectives to describe you? What strengths and characteristics do they perceive that you hadn’t identified yourself? What emotions do your colors, fonts, imagery, and tone evoke? It’s also important to remember that your personal brand can (and should) evolve with you! 
- [**Aim to have a complete personal branding guide by October 15, 2025**]{.teal-text} for reference during our website customization workshop. Specifically, we'll be calling on your color palette & [Google Font](https://fonts.google.com/){target="_blank"} selections to apply styling to your website (so it'll be helpful to at least have those defined).

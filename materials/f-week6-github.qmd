## {{< fa clipboard-list title="a clipboard with a To Do list" >}} Pre-workshop Prep {#pre-workshop-prep}

### A. Watch Abigail Haddad's posit::conf(2024) talk, *GitHub: How To Tell Your Professional Story* (15 min)

[Abigail Haddad](https://github.com/abigailhaddad){target="_blank"} is a Machine Learning Engineer at the US Department of Homeland Security. Her [posit::conf(2024)](https://posit.co/conference/){target="_blank"} talk, titled, [**GitHub: How To Tell Your Professional Story**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-bPjavai5A&list=PL9HYL-VRX0oSFkdF4fJeY63eGDvgofcbn&index=26){target="_blank"} is an excellent primer for thinking about GitHub as a professional portfolio.

### B. Choose a GitHub repo from a past homework assignment

README files are used to provide essential information about software projects. We'll practice writing effective READMEs, using a past MEDS homework assignment as an example. [**Choose one of the GitHub repositories from the list of past homework assignments, below:**]{.teal-text}
 
::: {.callout-note collapse=true}
## Choose from these candidate GitHub repositories

TBD 

<!-- **From EDS 223: Geospatial Analysis & Remote Sensing**

- [HW1: Map making practice](https://eds-223-geospatial.github.io/assignments/HW1.html){target="_blank"} (assigned 9/30, due 10/5)
- [HW2: Exploring patterns of environmental justice](https://eds-223-geospatial.github.io/assignments/HW2.html){target="_blank"} (assigned 10/7, due 10/19)

**For any non-MEDS students:** If you're enrolled in any data science-focused courses (MEDS or other) that have required you to create a GitHub repository(ies), I recommend choosing one of those. Otherwise, you can choose any repository you feel could use some added documentation. -->

### C. Draft up text to add to your GitHub profile README

A GitHub *profile* README is a special README that is displayed on your profile's landing page (e.g. see [mine](https://github.com/samanthacsik){target="_blank"}). A well-crafted profile README not only welcomes visitors to your page, but can also help you stand out to potential collaborators or employers. It's helpful to include a short bio and highlight some current projects / interests.

Consider what content you might want to include in *your* GitHub profile README (and remember to refer back to your branding guide!). Take a look at a few examples for inspiration, then [**draft up some text / images / etc. in a Google Doc (or other easily accessible location) to refer to during class**]{.teal-text} (it's okay if this is just a first pass -- you can continue to iterate!).

### D. Have a profile picture handy

We'll update our GitHub profile picture during class, if you haven't done so already. Ideally, this profile picture matches the one you've used for your other online portfolios (e.g. your personal website, LinkedIn, etc.). [**Save it to an easy-to-find place (e.g your desktop).**]{.teal-text}

## {{< fa plus title="plus" >}} What should I continue working on? {#continue-working}

- [**Put any finishing touches on your homework repo’s README.**]{.teal-text} If you’re feeling particularly inspired, you can also add / update READMEs for your other homework (or even personal) repositories as well. 
- [**Complete your GitHub profile bio and README.**]{.teal-text} Remember, your README should evolve with you. Consider revisiting it a few times throughout the year to make updates as you start (and complete) projects. You can add / switch out your pinned repos as well.

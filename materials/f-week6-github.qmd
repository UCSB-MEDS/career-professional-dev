## {{< fa clipboard-list title="a clipboard with a To Do list" >}} Pre-workshop Prep {#pre-workshop-prep}

Please be sure to complete the following before class:

### A. Watch Abigail Haddad's posit::conf(2024) talk, *GitHub: How To Tell Your Professional Story* (15 min)

[Abigail Haddad](https://github.com/abigailhaddad){target="_blank"} is a Machine Learning Engineer at the US Department of Homeland Security. Her [posit::conf(2024)](https://posit.co/conference/){target="_blank"} talk, titled, [**GitHub: How To Tell Your Professional Story**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-bPjavai5A&list=PL9HYL-VRX0oSFkdF4fJeY63eGDvgofcbn&index=26){target="_blank"} is an excellent primer for thinking about GitHub as a professional portfolio.

### B. Choose a GitHub repo from a past homework assignment

README files are used to provide essential information about software projects. We'll practice writing effective READMEs, using a past MEDS homework assignment as an example. [**Choose one of the GitHub repositories from the list of past homework assignments, below:**]{.teal-text}
 
::: {.callout-note collapse=true}
## Choose from these candidate GitHub repositories

TBD 

<!-- **From EDS 223: Geospatial Analysis & Remote Sensing**

- [HW1: Map making practice](https://eds-223-geospatial.github.io/assignments/HW1.html){target="_blank"} (assigned 9/30, due 10/5)
- [HW2: Exploring patterns of environmental justice](https://eds-223-geospatial.github.io/assignments/HW2.html){target="_blank"} (assigned 10/7, due 10/19)

**For any non-MEDS students:** If you're enrolled in any data science-focused courses (MEDS or other) that have required you to create a GitHub repository(ies), I recommend choosing one of those. Otherwise, you can choose any repository you feel could use some added documentation. -->

### C. Draft up text to add to your GitHub profile README

A GitHub *profile* README is a special README that is displayed on your profile's landing page (e.g. see [mine](https://github.com/samanthacsik){target="_blank"}). A well-crafted profile README not only welcomes visitors to your page, but can also help you stand out to potential collaborators or employers. It's helpful to include a short bio and highlight some current projects / interests.

Consider what content you might want to include in *your* GitHub profile README (and remember to refer back to your branding guide!). Take a look at a few examples for inspiration, then [**draft up some text / images / etc. in a Google Doc (or other easily accessible location) to refer to during class**]{.teal-text} (it's okay if this is just a first pass -- you can continue to iterate!).

## {{< fa plus title="plus" >}} What should I continue working on? {#continue-working}

- [**Put any finishing touches on your homework repo’s README.**]{.teal-text} If you’re feeling particularly inspired, you can also add / update READMEs for your other homework (or even personal) repositories as well. 
- [**Complete your GitHub profile bio and README.**]{.teal-text} Remember, your README should evolve with you. Consider revisiting it a few times throughout the year to make updates as you start (and complete) projects. You can add / switch out your pinned repos as well.

    "text": "Pre-class Prep\nPlease be sure to complete the following before the workshop:\n\nA. Install software / Create accounts\nMEDS students should already have the following installed / created from summer session (but it’s worth double-checking!):\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo follow along, you’ll need:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR & RStudio installed\nQuarto installed – Quarto is now included with RStudio v2022.07.1+ i.e. no need for a separate download / install if you have the latest version of RStudio\nGit installed / configured\nA GitHub account & a personal access token (PAT) set\n\nPlease refer to the MEDS Installation Guide for detailed setup instructions.\n\n\n\n\n\nB. Gather materials to add to your website’s landing page\nDuring this session, you’ll have the opportunity to add some personal information to your website’s landing page. It’ll help to have an idea of what you might want to include (at least as a starting point – your website’s content will most certainly evolve over time). Consider the following before attending the workshop:\n\nHave your professional headshot handy. Your Bren photo is a great option here! Save your photo to your Desktop (or somewhere you can easily find again) for now.\nConsider which landing page template to use. We’ll be applying one of Quarto’s five available built-in templates when we create our website’s landing page. Take a peek at the template previews and identify which one(s) you like most (e.g. I’m currently a fan of jolla, but used trestles for a long while). Consider how you’d like to arrange your personal bio / info given the layout of your top choice template.\nDraft your personal bio / blurb. Consider reusing parts of your Bren bio, or even drafting a shortened, catchy version of it for your landing page (and make note of the tips, below!). Save your text in a place you can quickly copy from during class (e.g. a Google Doc).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome considerations and example website bios\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdjust your bio to fit your chosen landing page template . For example, jolla works well with short bios or even taglines, while trestles might be a better choice if you’re looking to add longer and / or multiple sections.\nCheck out a few example websites for bio inspiration. Here are just a small handful fo websites, each with a slightly different approach to their landing page bios:\n\nSamantha Shanny-Csik (yours truly)\nNick Lyon (NCEAS Data Analyst)\nDaphne Virlar-Knight (MESM 2020)\nRay Hunter (MESM 2024)\nSam Muir (MEDS 2024)\nMelissa Widas (MEDS 2024)\nMarine Kochuten (MEDS 2025)\nHaylee Oyler (MEDS 2025)\nBrooke Grazda (MEDS 2025)\nOlivia Hemond (MESM 2025)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGather your important public profile links. Your personal website is an excellent place to link out to your other public profiles in one, organized place. Bookmark / save the links you’d like to include (e.g. LinkedIn, GitHub, even your preferred email address)"

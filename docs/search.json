    "text": "What should I continue working on?\n\nFinish applying your colors to different website elements using Quarto’s Sass variables. And test out different color combos and / or fonts if you’re not totally satisfied with your original choices. This is arguably the most fun part of building your website and where you can really let your personality and brand shine through. It can take a while to settle on something that you feel really represents you, and that’s okay (I’ve changed my entire color scheme and fonts multiple times over the years).\nConsider writing / borrowing / adapting CSS rules to refine your website styling. You can take your website styling far just by defining Quarto’s Sass variables. However, if you’re looking to fine-tune the appearance of certain web page elements, you may consider turning to more CSS. Review the workshop slides for suggested approaches and tools to guide your CSS-writing journey."

    "text": "Pre-workshop Prep\nPlease be sure to complete the following before the workshop:\n\nA. Install software / Create accounts\nMEDS students should already have the following installed / created from summer session (but it’s worth double-checking!):\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo follow along, you’ll need:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR & RStudio installed\nQuarto installed – Quarto is now included with RStudio v2022.07.1+ i.e. no need for a separate download / install if you have the latest version of RStudio\nGit installed / configured\nA GitHub account & a personal access token (PAT) set\n\nPlease refer to the MEDS Installation Guide for detailed setup instructions.\n\n\n\n\n\nB. Gather materials to add to your website’s landing page\nDuring this session, you’ll have the opportunity to add some personal information to your website’s landing page. It’ll help to have an idea of what you might want to include (at least as a starting point – your website’s content will most certainly evolve over time). Consider the following before attending the workshop:\n\nHave your professional headshot handy. Your Bren photo is a great option here! Save your photo to your Desktop (or somewhere you can easily find again) for now.\nConsider which landing page template to use. We’ll be applying one of Quarto’s five available built-in templates when we create our website’s landing page. Take a peek at the template previews and identify which one(s) you like most (e.g. I’m currently a fan of jolla, but used trestles for a long while). Consider how you’d like to arrange your personal bio / info given the layout of your top choice template.\nDraft a personal bio or tagline for your landing page. I recommend something that’s different than your Bren bio – a shorter, catchier one that’s infused with a bit more of your personality – though you may certainly consider reusing parts of your Bren bio (taglines are great here too!). Consider the tips and examples in the dropdown, below. Save your text in a place you can quickly copy from during class (e.g. your personal branding guide document!).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome considerations and example website bios\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResepct your readers’ time. The average attention span of an internet user is ~8 seconds, which means you want to succintly share your most important qualities, interests, and personal facts. Keeping website bios short and to-the-point is ideal. Save longer-form bios for a different page (e.g. I have a separate “about” page where I share about myself in a bit more detail)\n\nHere’s a nice short post on crafting a personal tagline and another with tips on writing a personal bio\n\nChoose the right landing page template for your bio. For example, jolla works well with short bios or taglines, while trestles might be a better choice if you’re looking to add longer and / or multiple sections.\nCheck out a few example websites for bio inspiration. Here are just a small handful of websites, each with a slightly different approach to their landing page bios:\n\nSamantha Shanny-Csik (yours truly)\nNick Lyon (NCEAS Data Analyst)\nRay Hunter (MESM 2024)\nSam Muir (MEDS 2024)\nMelissa Widas (MEDS 2024)\nMarine Kochuten (MEDS 2025)\nOlivia Hemond (MESM 2025)\nLeilanie Rubinstein (MEDS 2025)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGather your important public profile links. Your personal website is an excellent place to link out to your other public profiles in one, organized place (again, your personal branding guide is a great place to keep these). Bookmark / save the links you’d like to include (e.g. LinkedIn, GitHub, even your preferred email address)"

Consider what information you include and your tone – does it make sense to revise your bio to better fit your brand? Consider if your chosen template suits your needs, or if a different layout might work better. Share your bio with friends, family, a Career Team member, etc. and ask for their thoughts / feedback. You should also revisit your bio regularly (at least once a year) to make sure the content is still relevant and reflects your professional and personal identity.\nConsider editing or adding additional pages. Your website scaffolding includes an “about” page where you may consider adding a longer-form biography or information. You may also decide to add additional pages, as needed.\nHide any pages that aren’t “complete.” Want to include an “about” page (e.g. like mine) but don’t quite have the content sorted out yet? It’s best to hide this until you’re ready to share something that’s fairly polished. Comment out the necessary pages in _quarto.yml (see example below), then rebuild your site and push to GitHub. Note that while you can do this for almost all in-progess pages, you must keep index.qmd “live” (i.e. don’t comment it out).\n\n\n\n\n_quarto.yml\n\nproject:\n  type: website\n  output-dir: docs\n\nwebsite:\n  title: \"My website title\"\n  navbar:\n    left:\n      - href: index.qmd\n        text: Home\n      # - about.qmd\n\n# ~ additional metadata excluded for brevity ~"

    "text": "What should I continue working on?\n\nCheck out some data science blogs! Reading other data science blogs is the best way to get a sense of not only the breadth of topics that folks in the community are writing about, but also the tone, writing styles, and creative approaches you might take as a blogger. Here are some example posts and bloggers that I really enjoy:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA small collection of bloggers to peruse:\n\n\n\n\n\nA handful of posts to showcase some different writing styles and topics areas:\n\nAn introduction to Python for R Users, by Rebecca Barter\nMy first live coding interview, by Maya Gans\nNotes from live code review of {soils}, by Jadey Ryan\nCreating typewriter-styled maps in {ggplot2}, by Nicola Rennie\nPorting the Openscapes website from blogdown to Quarto, by Sam Shanny-Csik\nUsing Amazon S3 with R, by Danielle Navarro\nSlidecrafting 101: Layout, by Emil Hvitfeldt\n\nAnd a few additional fun blogs to keep an eye on:\n\nMeghan Hall\nMeghan Harris\nCrystal Lewis\nCosima Meyer\nBeatriz Milz\nShannon Pileggi\nAlbert Rapp\nNicola Rennie\nCédric Scherer\nCara Thompson\nNick Tierney\nIsabella Velásquez\nrostrum.blog (by Matt Dray and Adriana De Palma)\n\n\nSome bloggers have a really recgonizable brand, including:\n\nCédric Scherer’s blog is one of the first places I turn to when I’m looking for data viz / {ggplot2} content\nCrystal Lewis’ blog features lots of tutorials and conversations about data management practices\nDanielle Navarro’s blog largely chronicles her experiences learning new tools and creating generative art\n\nNOTE: You (most likely) will not have your brand identity fully sorted and solidified by this point (and that’s perfectly okay!). The above examples are meant to show how working towards finding your brand can (over time) help build a pattern of trust that draws visitors back to your website in search of familiar content.\n\n\n\n\n(Very much optional, but encouraged!) Add potential blog post topics / ideas to your personal branding guide You’ll be asked to write blog posts as part of your MEDS coursework, but that shouldn’t stop you from also writing blog posts on topics that interest you, seperate from your assignments! Coming up with topics to blog about can feel intimidating (especially in the beginning), however your personal branding guide can help to steer you in a productive direction. Recall that your personal brand shapes how you present yourself, not only in your aesthetic choices, but also the types of content you choose to publish and the tone you use throughout. Consider the following as you brainstorm potential blog post topics:\n\nWhat do your personal branding adjectives and key messages say about you and your interests?\nWhat topics blend your current interests and expertise with your future learning goals?\nWhat might draw someone to your website over a different website? Consider how your brand can help to define your niche.\nNot all data science blog posts need to be technical (e.g. include example code) – reflections and commentary on different aspects of your data science journey can be equally as valuable.\nUltimately, you should be choosing something you’re excited to write about (it can be easier to engage a reader when you yourself are jazzed about the topic)!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNeed some help kickstarting the creativity? Here are some potential blog post topics / ideas to consider:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhow your past professional or personal interests led you to pursue a degree in environmental data science\nnon-data science skills / experiences that you’ve found to be transferable to your data science learning journey (in perhaps surprising / unexpected ways)\nadvice you wish you had before beginning a data science graduate program\nwriting a data product-focused MEDS Capstone or MESM Group Project proposal\nreflecting on the MEDS 6-week summer coding bootcamp\nyour journey towards discovering your personal brand identity / building your website(!)\nwhat early data science skills you’ve found most valuable or surprising (so far), and why\na mini tutorial on a focused data science skill / topic, e.g. \nhow a particular function(s) or package has helped you overcome a data challenge, and why / how\na data science workflow or organizational procedure you’ve adopted, and why\nbuilding a data visualization or other creative product\n\nIt’s still valuable (and important) to think about how your framing, tone, and focus within each of these suggested topic areas fits your brand identity."

It’s okay if your ideas are still broad or evolving. Use this time to explore and stay curious; this early reflection will help you approach your job search with more focus later on.\nOnce you have a few areas or organizations in mind, start identifying people you could talk to—such as alumni, current students, or professionals in your network. Use the BrenConnect Alumni & Student Finder, LinkedIn, and personal/professional connections to find potential contacts.\nOver the next few weeks, reach out to 1-3 people to request short informational interviews.
